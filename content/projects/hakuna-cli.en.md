## About the project

The Hakuna CLI  is a simple Go application that interacts with the API of the time
tracking tool [hakuna.ch](https://hakuna.ch) for creating new timers and viewing time
entries or absences. The supported output formats are ASCII-table, JSON and CSV.

The CLI uses the cobra command parser and takes some inspiration
for displaying tables form the LXC CLI.

I used the Project for learning Go in the week between Christmas and new year.

You can find the code for hakuna-cli on [GitHub](https://github.com/hdahlheim/hakuna-go).
